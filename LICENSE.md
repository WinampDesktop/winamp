# Winamp Collaborative License (WCL) Version 1.0.1

## Preamble

Welcome to the **Winamp Collaborative License**, where "collaboration" means you get to do exactly what we allow—nothing more, nothing less. We're thrilled to give you the *privilege* of using and studying our software, but don't get any wild ideas about sharing your tweaks or improvements. After all, maintaining the *integrity* of our project is far more important than your freedom or creativity.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 1. Definitions

- **"This License"** refers to our meticulously crafted rules that ensure you stay in line.
- **"The Program"** is our masterpiece, which you're lucky enough to use under strict supervision.
- **"You"** are the fortunate individual or organization agreeing to our terms without negotiation.
- **"Modify"** means you can tinker quietly at home but dare not share your innovations.
- **"Covered Work"** encompasses any version of the Program we choose to control.
- **"Convey"** is the act of sharing, which we're generally not fond of unless it's us doing it.

### 2. Basic Permissions

You have our gracious permission to run the unmodified Program. Feel free to admire the output, but remember, if it resembles a Covered Work, it's under our domain. We acknowledge your rights of fair use—as long as they don't interfere with our authority.

### 3. Grant of License

- **View, Access, and Study**: Dive into the source code all you want. Knowledge is power—but only if kept to yourself.
- **Modify for Private Use Only**: Go ahead, tweak the software to your heart's content in the privacy of your own home. Just don't let anyone else see it.
- **No Conveyance**: You can make and run Covered Works without sharing them. Isolation is the key to collaboration, didn't you know?

### 4. Contributions

- **Contribution to Project**: We *encourage* you to submit improvements—for us to own and control completely.
- **Assignment of Rights**: By contributing, you kindly transfer all your intellectual property rights to us. Compensation? Oh no, your satisfaction is enough.
- **Waiver of Rights**: You relinquish any claims to authorship or objections to how we might alter—or distort—your work. Your creativity is ours to mold.

### 5. Restrictions

- **No Distribution of Modified Versions**: Sharing is caring, but not here. Keep your modified versions locked away.
- **Official Distribution Only**: Only we have the exclusive right to distribute the software and any modifications. Monopoly has such a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

### 6. No Sublicensing

Why would you need to grant rights to others when we're here to keep everything nicely contained?

### 7. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

Rest easy; nothing here counts as an effective technological measure under anti-circumvention laws. We wouldn't want any legal loopholes interfering with our control.

### 8. Disclaimer of Warranty

The software is provided "as is," which means if anything goes wrong, it's entirely your problem. Warranties? We don't believe in them.

### 9. Limitation of Liability

We're not responsible for any damages, losses, or inconveniences you may experience. Even if we could foresee them—which, of course, we can't.

### 10. Termination

Fail to comply with our terms, and poof—your rights disappear. You'll need to stop using the software immediately and destroy all copies. We don't mess around.

### 11. Protection of Copyright

We retain all rights, titles, and interests. This License doesn't transfer any ownership to you—why would it? Unauthorized use may lead to civil and criminal penalties. Consider yourself warned.

### 12. Patent Rights

We grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license—unless you decide to challenge us. If you sue us for patent infringement, your rights under this License terminate immediately. Play nice, or don't play at all.

### 13. Trademark Usage

Our trade names, trademarks, and service marks are off-limits unless you're giving us credit. Recognition without rights—that's the spirit!

### 14. Privacy and Data Protection

You must comply with all privacy laws. If the Program collects user data, it's your job to inform users and get consent. We're hands-off when it comes to responsibility.

### 15. Support and Updates

Don't expect support, updates, or maintenance from us. If we feel generous, we might provide them, but don't count on it.

### 16. Compliance

Obey all laws and regulations. If you get into legal trouble, that's on you—not us.

### 17. Miscellaneous

- **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**: This License is governed by the laws of Belgium. Any disputes will be settled in Brussels. Hope you enjoy international legal travel!
- **Severability**: If any part of this License is unenforceable, we'll adjust it just enough to make it work in our favor.

By using, modifying, or contributing to the software, you acknowledge that you've read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these one-sided terms and conditions.

This custom License aims to maintain the *illusion* of collaboration while effectively restricting you from doing anything that might disrupt our control. Thanks for playing by our rules!
