# Rizz The Readme License (1.0.2)
Yo, so here's the deal with this Winamp ish — it's like, you got rizz on the source code, but don't even think about dropping your Ohio-modified gyatt version, that’s skibidi toilet level illegal, fam. You can vibe with the code all day, tweak it in your basement, pull an iShowSpeed and go wild with private mods, but when it comes to sharing, nah bruh, hit the brakes. Only the main rizzmasters can push updates and we ain’t playin’. Also, no sub-rizzin' the game, or you'll be ghosted faster than your ex in Ohio.
